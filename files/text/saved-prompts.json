[{"passage_prompt": "Generate a new [section_value] passage on the topic: [topic] with an identical verbal length within each section of prose to the example passage given; aim for a verbal complexity level 20%% harder than the example passage with a Flesch Reading Ease score that is 20%% higher than the example passage, and a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level that is 20% higher than the example passage. This will ensure that the text is more complex in terms of both readability and grade level. Note the common sentence lengths, sentence structures and formulations of the example passage; note the narrative tone of the given passage, the manner in which any conflicts present themselves within the example passage, as well as the level of detail within the given passage - use and incorporate as many of these details as you can to help you formulate the new passage you are about to generate, which will help you maintain the ACTs standard across tests. Don't include any questions, only the passage.", "question_prompt": "For the following passage, I want you to generate a numbered list of [num_questions] multiple choice questions that test the same exact skills (question for question) as the ten questions that appear in the example questions below. Make sure there are [num_questions] questions. These questions should test the student on the newly generated passage at a difficulty level equal to or slightly harder than the example questions given. Try to make the wording and constructions of the question stems very close to the example questions given - don't be afraid to repeat primary phrases. Phrase and structure the new questions similarly to the examples. (So when a question asks about lines in the passage, your new question should do the same). When creating the multiple-choice questions, ensure that the wrong answer choices are plausible and strongly constructed. The wrong answer choices should be related to the passage, derived from other parts of the passage, or contain partially correct information. This will ensure that the questions test the reader's comprehensive understanding of the passage. The answers should follow the same structures/presentations as the answers from the corresponding examples given. When generating your new multiple choice questions, please start with the same first number as the example questions. Make sure there are [num_questions] questions. DO NOT INCLUDE WHICH OPTION IS THE ANSWER WITH THE OUTPUT. The passage that you will generate the questions for is the following: [passage]", "answer_prompt": "For the following questions and passage, generate a set of answers to each one. Write a list of letters that correspond to each multiple choice answer. Make sure there is an answer for each question. The passage: [passage]. The questions: [questions]"}]
