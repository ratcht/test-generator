{"Reading": {"section_type": "Reading", "workbooks": [{"passage_groups": [{"passage": "Below is an example of the type of digital encryption that most people use to protect their online activity: the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The SSL protocol was developed in the mid-1990s by a team of cryptographers working for Netscape Communications Corporation. Today, it is the most widely used security protocol on the internet, providing a secure connection between a web server and a user's web browser. When you connect to a website that uses SSL, your browser first contacts the web server and requests that the server identify itself. The server sends back a copy of its SSL certificate, which includes a public key that your browser can use to encrypt the data it sends to the server. The browser then generates a unique session key, which it uses to encrypt all subsequent data so that only the web server can decrypt it. SSL is an essential security measure that allows people to conduct sensitive transactions online, such as banking and shopping, with confidence.\n\nDespite the widespread use of SSL, it is not perfect. Recently, a team of researchers discovered a vulnerability in SSL known as \"Heartbleed.\" Heartbleed is a flaw in OpenSSL, the open-source version of SSL, that allows attackers to read sensitive information, such as passwords and private keys, from vulnerable web servers. This vulnerability is considered one of the most significant in recent years, affecting billions of websites worldwide. To address this vulnerability, administrators have had to patch their systems, update their SSL keys, and revoke and reissue new SSL certificates. While Heartbleed was a wake-up call for many companies to take their online security more seriously, it also highlighted the constant cat-and-mouse game played by hackers and security experts in the world of cryptography. As technology evolves, so do the methods and tools used by both sides in the fight.\n\nSo, while SSL is certainly a valuable tool in the fight to protect our online activity, it is just the beginning of a much larger story. As we continue to rely more and more on technology to store and transmit our private data, we must remain vigilant and stay informed about the latest developments in the world of cryptography. Only then can we hope to stay one step ahead of those who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities.\n \nWord count - 247 words", "question_groups": [{"question": "1.
